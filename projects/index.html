            Interpreter for Scheme (lisp dialect) written with Python. Features usage of buffer and stack data structures. Properly applies tail recursive function calls so that it remains correct with proper Scheme convention. Very tough project and took extensive critical thinking, teamwork, and patience (the debugging was brutal). Includes exhaustive test cases. <a id="email" href="https://github.com/Deciente/Scheme" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>

        <h2>QuizUp</h2>
        <p>
            Do you have an exam where you have to memorize a lot of stuff (like biology)? Fear no more, QuizUp is here. It is an android app that allows you to input questions, and then answer them! This is an ongoing project. Thus far you can only input and answer True and False questions. Later I plan on adding different question types (such as MC and short answer) as well as question sets that you can save together. Check back for my progress in this project! <a id="email" href="https://github.com/Deciente/QuizUp-" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>
